## 2026-08-04 - React Array Render Re-renders
**Learning:** Found an opportunity where complex list operations (sorting and filtering) were running on every re-render in `VnpAnalyticsCards.tsx`.
**Action:** Always wrap heavy list mapping, filtering, and sorting in React `useMemo` hooks with proper dependencies to avoid unnecessary main thread blocking in heavily reactive UI components.

## 2023-10-25 - SVG Graph Node Lookups
**Learning:** Found a performance bottleneck specific to this codebase's architecture where `links.map` inside `CapabilityGraph.tsx` performed `nodes.find` for both source and target links on every render, causing O(N^2) lookups.
**Action:** When rendering connected network graphs or D3-like SVG elements that map over links, always pre-compute a `Map` (or dictionary) of nodes by their IDs outside the loop to achieve O(1) lookups instead of O(N).

## 2025-03-08 - SVG Graph Node Lookups in React Mappings
**Learning:** Found multiple instances of `O(N^2)` array operations in `BuildExecutionAttestation.tsx` (e.g., using `findIndex` inside `.filter` for deduplication, and `.find` inside a `.map` loop to resolve capability IDs and hover states).
**Action:** Use `Set` for `O(1)` array deduplication and pre-compute `Map` dictionaries for cross-array lookups before mapping over data structures to prevent blocking the main thread during React re-renders.

## 2026-09-07 - SVG Graph Node Lookups in React Mappings
**Learning:** Found multiple instances of `O(N^2)` array operations in `CognitiveIde.tsx` (e.g., using `.find` inside a `.map` loop to resolve capability IDs and hover states).
**Action:** Use `Set` for `O(1)` array deduplication and pre-compute `Map` dictionaries for cross-array lookups before mapping over data structures to prevent blocking the main thread during React re-renders.
## 2024-05-25 - React Hook Invalidation by Non-Memoized Parent Arrays
**Learning:** In heavily nested graph visualization components (like `CapabilityGraph`), building node arrays without `useMemo` implicitly regenerates their object identities on every render. Even if you correctly apply `useMemo` to downstream lookups or mappings (like `adjacencyMap` or `combinedCapabilitiesById` using those nodes), those hooks are completely nullified because their dependency arrays contain the frequently re-allocated node arrays.
**Action:** When building complex SVG graph states, explicitly memoize every intermediate dataset (nodes, edges, node dicts) that serves as a dependency for a subsequent derived computation. Ensure cascading lookups explicitly consume pre-computed `Map` instances rather than iterating linearly over the graph.
