## 2026-08-04 - React Array Render Re-renders
**Learning:** Found an opportunity where complex list operations (sorting and filtering) were running on every re-render in `VnpAnalyticsCards.tsx`.
**Action:** Always wrap heavy list mapping, filtering, and sorting in React `useMemo` hooks with proper dependencies to avoid unnecessary main thread blocking in heavily reactive UI components.

## 2023-10-25 - SVG Graph Node Lookups
**Learning:** Found a performance bottleneck specific to this codebase's architecture where `links.map` inside `CapabilityGraph.tsx` performed `nodes.find` for both source and target links on every render, causing O(N^2) lookups.
**Action:** When rendering connected network graphs or D3-like SVG elements that map over links, always pre-compute a `Map` (or dictionary) of nodes by their IDs outside the loop to achieve O(1) lookups instead of O(N).
